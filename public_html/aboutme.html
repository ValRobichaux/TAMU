    <section>
      Hello there! My name is Val Robichaux and I am a computer engineering
      major from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I am a mostly self taught programmer
      who loves learning new things like this for example!
      <p>
        CSS and HTML has been a very welcome change of pace for me. I love the
        experience of getting to do a lot of different jobs and having the
        experience to dive into something brand new! Like this, I also have
        experience in the unity game engine creating games with C#.  My main strengths
        are really in C++ and C branches because that is where I learned all of my foundations
        for coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking to expand my portfolio and resume by adding different kinds
        of fun coding projects that will further my career as a computer
        programmer! I constantly am looking for more and more experience in
        different fields, for example I have experience with data structures
        through my course work at A&M as well as basics of computer
        architechure. I love diving into new projects as it always presents
        me with a new learning opportunity. It doesn't take much decision making to
        decide on projects, as if I think it looks interesting I just get
        straight into it!  I have always been a learner by doing, and getting to work 
        on new projects and creating things as I go really excites me and gets me very
        passionate about my work.
      </p>
      On a more personal note, I am really passionate about making videos and
      trying to help others! I always thought that it was a great outlet to
      express my creativity as I like public speaking and leading others. I am
      really looking forward to making some tutorials over game
      development or coding development. A more personal side of me
      is that I really want to start a podcast or a talkshow because I have a
      lot of very creative ideas and I would love to have an outlet to share
      them with the world. Overall I really enjoyed this first project!

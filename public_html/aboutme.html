  <section>
       Hello there! My name is Val Robichaux and I am a computer engineering major from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
       I am a mostly self taught programmer who loves learning new things like this for example!<p> CSS and HTML has
       been a very welcome change of pace for me.  I love the experience of getting to do 
       a lot of different jobs and having the experience to just dive into something brand new!
       Like this, I also have some experience in the unity game engine creating games with C#.  
       I have been very used to coding in mostly C++ and other branches of C because that is what I have been taught my entire school career.</p>
       <p>I am looking to expand my portfolio and resume by adding different kinds of fun coding projects that will further
       my career as a computer programmer!
       I constantly am looking for more and more experience in different fields, for example I have experience with 
       data structures through my course work at A&M as well as basics of computer architechure.  When looking for new projects,
       I keep my mind as open as possible and dive in.  It doesn't take much decision making time to decide on projects, as if I think
       it looks interesting I just get straight into it!  I never know when this type of experience will help me in life or what kinds of 
       opportunities may present themselves so why not dive in and find out! </p>
       On a more personal note, I am really passionate about making videos and trying to help others! I always thought that it was a great outlet to
       express my creativity as I like public speaking and leading others.  I am really looking forward to maybe making some
       tutoriols over game development or coding development in general.
       A more personal side of me is that I really want to start a podcast or a talkshow because I have a lot of very creative
       ideas and I would love to have an outlet to share them with the world.
       Overall I really enjoyed this first project!

            <h3>Code for Good</h3>
            <img src="code for good.jpg" atl="Code for good charity" style="width:30%">
           <p>
               Currently I am enrolled to a program and contest called code for good that is being hosted
               by JPMorgan.  Code for good is a hackathon that allows other coders to collagborate with each other 
               in order to develop innovative technology solutions for nonprofit organizations.  It will also help me start
               learning about a technology career with JPMorgan.
           </p>
           <p>
               I got involved with this due to the sheer amount of good that this brings to so many people.
               Organizaitons that are smaller may not have access to enough capital in order to purchase 
               vital software for the growth of their business.  This type of competition helps bridge 
               that gap and really form good connections between other smaller or larger companies.

            <h3>Volunteer Services I want to get involved in</h3>
            <img src="logo.png" atl="Beautiful Abilities" style="width:30%">
            <p>
                This is a service I am really passionate about getting involved in and trying to help out those
                that are not as fortunate as us.  Knowing and have been around people with disabilities has really
                shed a light on how many different challenges face their every day lives and how grateful we are to not 
                have those inconviences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would really like to start reaching out to those that are less fortunate and maybe start a tutoring 
                service or session.  This way I can put my knowledge and school hours to use in order to help those who 
                aren't as fortune as I am.

        <h3 style="text-decoration:underline">My favorite things about CS!</h3>
        <p>
            One things that originally drove me into Computer Science and Computer Engineering 
            was my love for video games growing up.  That is where it all began because I thought
            to myself that "wow it would be so cool if I got to make these types of things!"
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting into CS my eyes really opened up to how great of a career path this is and
            how open it is to new ideas and up coming users.  Computer science really is for everyone
            and I think that everyone at some point in their life should learn how to code or atleast
            take a good ol' college try at it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computer science allows for so much self expression and creativity.  Think of how many people 
            have released amazing content over the years because of programming!  It allows for so much 
            artistic expression as well as computation.  Computer Science goes hand in hand with so many aspects
            of life and I really love that about this careeer.  It is so versatile and you could be working on so 
            many different projects or find yourself in so many different fields.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I think this is what mainly drew me to computer science, it is so versatile and it welcomes new ideas.
            I have always been a huge dreamer with an enormous imagination and computer science has done nothing
            but allowed me to express myself in the largest degree.
